    {"msg":"As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once"},
    {"msg":"Loved you yesterday, love you still, always have, always will"},
    {"msg":"I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more"},
    {"msg":"I love you not only for what you are, but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself, but for what you are making of me. I love you for the part of me that you bring out"},
    {"msg":"Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive"},
    {"msg":"I need you like a heart needs a beat"},
    {"msg":"When I say I love you more, I don’t mean I love you more than you love me. I mean I love you more than the bad days ahead of us, I love you more than any fight we will ever have. I love you more than the distance between us, I love you more than any obstacle that could try and come between us. I love you the most"},
    {"msg":"If I know what love is, it is because of you."},
    {"msg":"I fell in love with her courage, her sincerity, and her flaming self respect. And it’s these things I’d believe in, even if the whole world indulged in wild suspicions that she wasn’t all she should be. I love her and it is the beginning of everything."},
    {"msg":"I swear I couldn’t love you more than I do right now, and yet I know I will tomorrow."},
    {"msg":"If you live to be a hundred, I want to live to be a hundred minus one day so I never have to live without you."},
    {"msg":"A man is already halfway in love with any woman who listens to him."},
    {"msg":"I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul."},
    {"msg":"Women are meant to be loved, not to be understood."},
    {"msg":"You make me want to be a better man."},
    {"msg":"Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive."},
    {"msg":"There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, throbbing moment."},
    {"msg":"Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own."},
    {"msg":"Love never dies a natural death. It dies because we don’t know how to replenish its source. It dies of blindness and errors and betrayals. It dies of illness and wounds; it dies of weariness, of witherings, of tarnishings."},
    {"msg":"He is not a lover who does not love forever."},
    {"msg":"To love is to burn, to be on fire."},
    {"msg":"Love does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up."},
    {"msg":"In the end we discover that to love and let go can be the same thing."},
    {"msg":"Pleasure of love lasts but a moment. Pain of love lasts a lifetime."},
    {"msg":"To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything and your heart will be wrung and possibly broken. If you want to make sure of keeping it intact you must give it to no one, not even an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements. Lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket, safe, dark, motionless, airless, it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. To love is to be vulnerable."},
    {"msg":"Love is an untamed force. When we try to control it, it destroys us. When we try to imprison it, it enslaves us. When we try to understand it, it leaves us feeling lost and confused."},
    {"msg":"Love is so short, forgetting is so long."},
    {"msg":"Love is a thing that is full of cares and fears."},
    {"msg":"Love is not love until love’s vulnerable."},
    {"msg":"You know you’re in love when you can’t fall asleep because reality is finally better than your dreams."},
    {"msg":"I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close."},
    {"msg":"Love is like the wind, you can’t see it but you can feel it."},
    {"msg":"Love is the magician that pulls man out of his own hat."},
    {"msg":"The best love is the kind that awakens the soul; that makes us reach for more, that plants the fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds. That’s what I hope to give you forever."},
    {"msg":"I would rather spend one lifetime with you, than face all the ages of this world alone."},
    {"msg":"To be your friend was all I ever wanted; to be your lover was all I ever dreamed."},
    {"msg":"My wish is that you may be loved to the point of madness."},
    {"msg":"A purpose of human life, no matter who is controlling it, is to love whoever is around to be loved."},
    {"msg":"Romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze."},
    {"msg":"Love is always patient and kind. It is never jealous. Love is never boastful or conceited. It is never rude or selfish. It does not take offense and is not resentful. Love takes no pleasure in other people’s sins, but delights in the truth. It is always ready to excuse, to trust, to hope, and to endure whatever comes."},
    {"msg":"Love is the strange bewilderment which overtakes one person on account of another person."},
    {"msg":"One word frees us of all the weight and pain of life: that word is love."},
    {"msg":"Flatter me, and I may not believe you. Criticize me, and I may not like you. Ignore me, and I may not forgive you. Encourage me, and I will not forget you. Love me and I may be forced to love you."},
    {"msg":"It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."},
    {"msg":"This has been my life; I found it worth living."},
    {"msg":"We must be our own before we can be another’s."},
    {"msg":"Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life."},
    {"msg":"Let the beauty of what you love be what you do."},
    {"msg":"Only true love can fuel the hard work that awaits you."},
    {"msg":"Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well."},
    {"msg":"Just don’t give up trying to do what you really want to do. Where there’s love and inspiration, I don’t think you can go wrong."},
    {"msg":"Pursue some path, however narrow and crooked, in which you can walk with love and reverence."},
    {"msg":"Do what you love, and you will find the way to get it out to the world."},
    {"msg":"You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection."},
    {"msg":"Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin, as self-neglecting."},
    {"msg":"I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they’re right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together."},
    {"msg":"I have decided to stick to love; hate is too great a burden to bear."},
    {"msg":"The greatest thing you’ll ever learn is to love and be loved in return."},
    {"msg":"I hope you know that every time I tell you to get home safe, stay warm, have a good day, or sleep well what I am really saying is I love you. I love you so damn much that it is starting to steal other words’ meanings."},
    {"msg":"The greatest degree of inner tranquility comes from the development of love and compassion. The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater is our own sense of well-being."},
    {"msg":"Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none."},
    {"msg":"You call it madness, but I call it love."},
    {"msg":"We can only learn to love by loving."},
    {"msg":"A life lived in love will never be dull."},
    {"msg":"Life is the flower for which love is the honey."},
    {"msg":"All you need is love."},
    {"msg":"True love stories never have endings."},
    {"msg":"Love is shown more in deeds than in words."},
    {"msg":"Love is not a volunteer thing."},
    {"msg":"Love is friendship on fire."},
    {"msg":"Love is the ultimate expression of the will to live."},
    {"msg":"Love is what makes the ride worthwhile."},

    {"msg":"You’ve gotta dance like there’s nobody watching, Love like you’ll never be hurt, Sing like there’s nobody listening, And live like it’s heaven on earth."},
    {"msg":"Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that."},
    {"msg":"Age does not protect you from love, but love to some extent protects you from age."},
    {"msg":"Love is never lost. If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart."},
    {"msg":"Life is the first gift, love is the second, and understanding the third."},
    {"msg":"You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back."},
    {"msg":"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."},
    {"msg":"People think a soul mate is your perfect fit, and that’s what everyone wants. But a true soul mate is a mirror, the person who shows you everything that is holding you back, the person who brings you to your own attention so you can change your life."},
    {"msg":"I’m here. I love you. I don’t care if you need to stay up crying all night long, I will stay with you. There’s nothing you can ever do to lose my love. I will protect you until you die, and after your death I will still protect you. I am stronger than depression and I am braver than loneliness and nothing will ever exhaust me."},
    {"msg":"Love is the emblem of eternity; it confounds all notion of time; effaces all memory of a beginning, all fear of an end."},
    {"msg":"Love is an emotion experienced by the many and enjoyed by the few."},
    {"msg":"Love is more than a noun – it is a verb; it is more than a feeling – it is caring, sharing, helping, sacrificing."},
    {"msg":"Love is a choice you make from moment to moment."},
    {"msg":"We need not think alike to love alike."},
    {"msg":"Love is a great master. It teaches us to be what we never were."},
    {"msg":"Love is the expansion of two natures in such fashion that each include the other, each is enriched by the other."},
    {"msg":"Love does not consist of gazing at each other, but in looking together in the same direction."},
    {"msg":"Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profundity. Kindness in giving creates love."},
    {"msg":"When our community is in a state of peace, it can share that peace with neighboring communities, and so on. When we feel love and kindness towards others, it not only makes others feel loved and cared for, but it helps us also to develop inner happiness and peace."},
    {"msg":"Love is sharing your popcorn."},
    {"msg":"Love is being stupid together."},

    {"msg":"Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love."},
    {"msg":"Love is like pi – natural, irrational, and very important."},
    {"msg":"We’re all a little weird. And life is a little weird. And when we find someone whose weirdness is compatible with ours, we join up with them and fall into mutually satisfying weirdness—and call it love—true love."},
    {"msg":"Love is something sent from heaven to worry the hell out of you."},
    {"msg":"There is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness."},
    {"msg":"Love means having to say you’re sorry every fifteen minutes."},
    {"msg":"A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous."},
    {"msg":"Love: a temporary insanity, curable by marriage."},
    {"msg":"What the world really needs is more love and less paperwork."},
    {"msg":"Love is like Heaven, but it can hurt like Hell."},
    {"msg":"It is not love that makes a relationship complicated; it’s the people in it who do."},
    {"msg":"Gravitation is not responsible for people falling in love."},
    {"msg":"Love is an ocean of emotions entirely surrounded by expenses."},
    {"msg":"Love is a lot like a backache, it doesn’t show up on X-rays, but you know it’s there."},
    {"msg":"I love you more than coffee, but please don’t make me prove it."},
    {"msg":"We accept the love we think we deserve."},
    {"msg":"You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life."},
    {"msg":"I saw that you were perfect, and so I loved you. Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more."},

    {"msg":"To be brave is to love someone unconditionally, without expecting anything in return."},
    {"msg":"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height My soul can reach."},
    {"msg":"The best thing to hold onto in life is each other."},
    {"msg":"Love makes your soul crawl out from its hiding place."},
    {"msg":"The chance to love and be loved exists no matter where you are."},
    {"msg":"I believe there are some things in life you can’t deny or rationalize, and [love] is one of them."},
    {"msg":"Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired."},
    {"msg":"You know it’s love when all you want is that person to be happy, even if you’re not part of their happiness."},
    {"msg":"For small creatures such as we, the vastness is bearable only through love."},
